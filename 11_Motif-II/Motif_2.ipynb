In the inclass_data/ folder, there are two files you will need for this analysis: tdp_downreg_genes.txt, which contains the 88 genes that were significantly downregulated by at least 2-fold when the protein was mutated,  and all_tdp_genes.txt, which contains the 10,601 genes that met the minimum read count threshold in this experiment. You will probably want to download these files to your own computer so that you can upload them easily without having to copy and paste 10,000 genes.

There are many ways to accomplish this: one easy way is to download the PWM, read it into R, and use the t() command to transpose it. Then, you can write that result out as a table and copy and paste it to get it into JASPAR.
