    "* Use R and the Bioconductor package to load libraries and tools required for the analysis of these data\n",

    "For those also interested, we include a couple of optional features which may be of interest:\n",

    "It turns out that there are a wide range of technologies used to assay gene expression in the genome. A short review of the types of microarray technologies are given in the first part of a paper by Miller and Tang (2009). (see paper in Canvas)\n",
    "\n",
    "But not only do the types of technology used to assay gene expression differ, the types of transcripts that are assayed by a given microarray will also differ:\n",
    "* One might want to use a small collection of probes to query all transcripts. \n",

    "* Or alternatively still, only a subset of all transcripts (ie. 'onco-chips' which select only cancer-related oncogenes or tumor supressor genes). \n",

    "\n",
    "* Gene expression microarrays allow the survey of the expression of virtual all genes in the genome, at a specfic point in time. Often, in different treated or untreated states.<br \\>\n",
    "* One objective of these experiments is to determine if the expression of a given gene is different between treatments, conditions, or tissues: i.e.<br \\>\n",
    "H0 = The condition has no effect on the expression of a gene (β = 0) <br \\>\n",
    "H1 = The condition has an effect on the expression of a gene (β != 0) <br \\>\n",
    "and our goal is to determine if β is significantly different from zero. \n",
    "* Here, note that we are describing the hypothesis test for a __single__ gene. In a single microarray experiment, we assay thousands of genes, simultaneously. As a result, **_mutliple-hypothesis testing issues apply_**. <br \\> \n",
    "In other words, we should not consider all genes that have a nominal P < 0.05 to \"significantly differ\" in levels of gene expression (e.g. if 1000 genes were tested, we'd expect 50 by chance to score P < 0.05. Not what we want!). The levels of significance require burden of proof given the number of genes (and hypotheses) tested. There are ways apply correction for mutliple testing, and we'll go over some of that later.\n",
    "* A corollary to this question is to identify specific sets of genes (or pathways) that differ between these groups; typically, we think about the use of gene sets from Gene Ontology or curated sets of Pathways to test these hypotheses.\n",
    "* The design of an experiment follows this general workflow:"

These files contain a bunch of information how how the intensity value for the given probe was calculated, and summary statistics for that intensity (mean, standard deviation), in addition to perhaps other pieces of information about the experiment performed. <br \\> Unfortunately, these files are quite large and, consequently, are stored in a binary (not-human readable) format: if you try to 'peek' at them in UNIX (using less, or more, or head), you'll probably get a bunch of jibberish.
