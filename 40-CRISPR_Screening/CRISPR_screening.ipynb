Science 2015</a>) that compared gene essentiality between four different cell lines. We will use the (<a href=\"https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0554-4\">MaGECK pipeline</a>) to analyze the data. We have already installed this pipeline for you in your unix environment.\n",

    "**Q2** Now we would like to run the MAGeCK pipeline to compare KBM7 final to initial time point. We expect that sgRNAs which target genes that are essential for KBM7 growth to be depleted from the final time point. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/demo/#the-first-tutorial-starting-from-read-count-tables\">tutorial</a> on how to run MAGeCK when starting from a read count table. Run this in the unix terminal and provide the one line of unix code below. Use the two KBM7 final samples as your treatment and two KBM7 initial samples as your control. Use `KBM7` for the prefix of your output files."

    "* We would like to compare gene essentiality between the four cell lines provided in our data sets. For this, run MAGeCK three more times for the three additional cell lines `K562`, `Jiyoye` and `Raji`. Then load the gene summary data and use `tidyverse` to construct a data set that contains the `neg.fdr` for each cell line. Use a fdr cutoff of 0.05 again, how many genes are shared between all cell lines? \n",
    "\n",
    "* Take a look at the following paper <a href=\"https://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/6/8/824.long\">paper</a>, apparently CRISPR screens for gene depletion can have false positives due to targeting of chromosomal regions that are amplified. The reason for that is that if you use Cas9 to target a region that is amplified many times, the excessive DNA damage induced by Cas9 can have a toxic effect. K562 cells are know to have an amplification in chromosome 22. Let's check if this is reflected in our data as well, we have provided you with genomic coordinates for all genes in the file `gene_start.tab`, plot gene depletion scores (`-log10(neg.p.value)`) as a function of genomic location for chromosome 22 to test if there is a region of the chromosome that displays clustered gene depletion.\n",
