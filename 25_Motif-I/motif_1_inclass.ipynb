One very common alternative representation that retains this information is the <b>probability weight matrix (PWM)</b>, which is a matrix with 4 rows, one for each nucleotide, and a number of columns corresponding to the length of the motif.

For example, if we want to quantify how well the motif 'AGAGGAA' (which was our exact consensus sequence) matches, we just go through and multiply 0.66 \\* 0.5 \\* 0.5 \\* 1.0 \\* 1.0 \\* 1.0 \\* 0.66 = .1089. One major issue with using this approach is the fact that some of these cells contain '0.0' as their probability. Consider the motif 'CGAGGAA', which only differs from our exact consensus sequence by a single base pair.

    "### Generating positional weight matrices\n",
    "A further refinement to this idea is to correct these probabilities for the background distribution of bases in the genome you are interested in. Doing this, we can define <b>positional weight matrices</b>. To do this, after we have obtained the matrix of probabilities including pseudocounts (i.e. the table directly above this one), we divide each entry in each row by the background probability of observing the nucleotide corresponding to that row. In the naive case, we just use <i>p(i)</i> = 0.25 for each nucleotide <i>i</i>. This assumes an equal probability of observing any given nucleotide. Finally, a common transformation is to take the natural logarithm (ln, or log base e) of each of these background-corrected quantities (note that these are no longer probabilities). This is done so that in order to compute the score for a given sequence, the entries in each row can be added instead of multiplied together. In our example above, applying these transformations using the naive nucleotide distribution yields the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table width=100%><tr><th>Nucleotide</th><th>Pos. 1 Log-odds</th><th>Pos. 2 Log-odds</th><th>Pos. 3 Log-odds</th><th>Pos. 4 Log-odds</th><th>Pos. 5 Log-odds</th><th>Pos. 6 Log-odds</th><th>Pos. 7 Log-odds</th></tr>\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, the corrected probability of any given sequence can be computed by simply adding the entries corresponding to that sequence. If the score is greater than 0, the sequence is more likely to be a functional than a 'random' sequence, and if the score is less than 0, the reverse is true. This is why the column titles refer to the 'log-odds': this model represents the 'odds' or likelihood that a given sequence matches the motif.

In other words, we want to know how well a motif, as represented by a PWM, can discriminate between a real signal and background noise. To do so, we can take advantage of a very useful and powerful concept called the <b>information content (IC)</b> of a motif. This is a way of directly quantifying how informative a signal is, and applications of this concept can be found in a wide range of fields from computer encryption to machine learning to physics. In this case, we define the information content of each column $j$ in the PWM (i.e. each position in the motif) as $IC_j = 2 + \\sum_{x=A,C,G,T} p_x log_2(p_x)$, where $p_x$ is the entry for nucleotide $x$ in that column.

Relative entropy measures this 'randomness' or 'disorderedness' of a given motif relative to the background distribution.

Recall that this involves counting the nucleotide occurrences at each position, adding a psuedocount of 1, normalizing this into probabilities of each base, and finding the log odds by taking the natural log of each probability divided by the frequency of that nucleotide in the genome. <b>(1 point)</b>"
