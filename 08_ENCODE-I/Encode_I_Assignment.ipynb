As you can see, it is very difficult to quickly tell this from looking at just the epigenetic marks. Luckily, there are tools that make computational predictions about the functional activity of a region by combining many epigenetic marks. One such tool is chromHMM. Look at the chromHMM tracks by loading the ENCODE histone modification track. Is there an enhancer directly upstream of this gene in any of the assayed cell type? If so, which one?
