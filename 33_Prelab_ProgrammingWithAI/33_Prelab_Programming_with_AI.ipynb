As noted in the Course Syllabus (https://github.com/bvoight/GCB535/blob/master/Syllabus.md), we strongly believe that building one's own computational skillset is important for educational purposes. At the same time, generative artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as Chat GPT have been quickly adopted for helping to speed up computational work. We would be remiss not to walk through how such AI methods can enhance bioinformatics analyses. \n",
