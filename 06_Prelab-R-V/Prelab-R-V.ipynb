I find that using cheatsheets (with some pictures) is very helpful for  to 'visualize' what one want to accomplish; then, use function references to get the syntax of the code just right.\n",

The good news for you is that sometimes, those style choices are embedded in code that you can reuse for your purposes! So with a little bit of searching, and understanding of syntax, you can adopt those extensions and code for your specific uses."
