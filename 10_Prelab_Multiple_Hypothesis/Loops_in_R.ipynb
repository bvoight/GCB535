    "In R, when we have had to do *iteratively* do something to a data table (e.g., `mutate()`, or `summarize()`), we've taken advantage of how R is set up to this very efficiently ('vectorizing'). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are other ways in which you can iterate or 'loop' through a table or a list: `for` loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this prelab, we'll introduce you to this main type of loop. In general, loops do pretty much exactly what you'd expect based on the name -- they let you \"loop\" over a piece of code over and over until a certain condition has been met, or we run out of things to compute on.\n",

    "Much of the below is inspired and summarized from [Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's: *R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html), which gives a great view of the basics and more details if you are interested in (beyond what we have time to go through here). Let's start by executing the following commands below."
