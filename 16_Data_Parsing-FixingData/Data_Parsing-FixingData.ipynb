    "Remember: The goal here is NOT to edit the actual raw data file with a text editor. Often times, data sets are simply too large to do this feasibly. In addition, keeping a \"raw\" unedited version of data *sacrosanct* is essential purposes of reproducibility: when attempting computational validation of a result, computational scientists will often want to start from a common \"starting point\" (i.e., a file the downloaded from the public domain) and get to the same place as your pipelines do. As such, building pipelines that start from that common, very raw (and messy) data file really helps with that.\n",
