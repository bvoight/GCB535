    "Imagine that you are a grad student who has just begun work in a mouse lab. Your advisor, Dr. Stoker, works on a novel mouse phenotype, which has been dubbed Vampiric. Mice with this phenotype have the physiological feature of exceptionally sharp teeth and the behavioral feature of biting other mice. Dr. Stoker has developed a genetic mutagenesis screen for this phenotype using sunlight as a negative selector. In one strain of Vampiric mice, the mutation has been narrowed to an approximately 250-kilobase (kb) region of chromosome 12. Your first task is to investigate what is known about candidate genes in this region."
