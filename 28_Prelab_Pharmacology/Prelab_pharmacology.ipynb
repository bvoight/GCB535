    "For our activity for this unit, we have decided to focus on the analysis of data from high-throughput cell screening data. In industry, this is routinely done, for drug discovery, target identification, lead compound optimization, assay development, and more. On Canvas, we have provided you two papers (as some brief overview) to describe the process, features, misconceptions, and examples. See Szyma≈Ñski et al (2012) and Macarron et al (2011). \n",
