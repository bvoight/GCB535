    "Your colleague has just finished an extensive karyotyping study across samples from many different types of human cancers. She specifically looked for regions of the genome that have a statistically significant rate of chromosomal aberrations (including inversions, deletions, and translocations). She has asked you to help her analyze her results, starting with a region she identified on chromosome 6, ranging from base pairs 108,510,000 to 109,500,000 using NCBI build 36 (hg18). Use UCSC Genome Browser and/or other public databases to view information about known genes in this region."
