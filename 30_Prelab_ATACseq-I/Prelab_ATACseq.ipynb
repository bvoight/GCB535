    "Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a technique to assess chromatin accessibility across the genome. This method provides insight into the regulatory architecture of the genome by highlighting regions of open chromatins that are potentially active in gene regulation. ATAC-seq can be applied to both bulk samples and single cells, enabling the exploration of chromatin dynamics at various resolutions."

Tn5 simultaneously fragments DNA and tags open chromatin regions with sequencing adapters—a process known as \"tagmentation.\" This method enables researchers to identify regions of the genome that are accessible to transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins, providing insights into gene regulation, epigenetic modifications, and cellular function."

    "\n",
    "  - TF (Term Frequency): This measures how frequently a term occurs in a specific document. A higher frequency of a term, such as \"hepatocyte\" in a document, suggests the document is likely related to liver biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - DF (Document Frequency): This measures how frequently a term occurs across all documents in the corpus. A term like \"mitosis\" might appear in various biological contexts, making it less unique and thereby less important for distinguishing between documents.\n",
    "  - IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): This counters the TF by diminishing the weight of terms that occur very frequently across the corpus and increasing the weight of terms that occur rarely. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - TF-IDF: The product of TF and IDF for a term reflects its importance in a given document relative to the entire corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "- SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) is then used on the matrix of TF-IDF scores to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. This step identifies the most significant axes or directions in the data, which captures the most variance among the documents (cells in the context of scATAC-seq). This enables better interpretation and analysis of the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

    "Together, these techniques help in efficiently summarizing and interpreting large scATAC-seq datasets, enabling researchers to focus on the most informative aspects of chromatin accessibility across different cells."
