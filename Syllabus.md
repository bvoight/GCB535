## Location and time

* The course will be administered on campus for Spring 2022

## Office hours

Office hours are time that we (the instructors and TAs) set aside for you to 
drop by to talk about the course and ask any questions that you may have.

This year, we are hosting office hours virtually, which will correspond to a
designated time where a TA or instructor will be available to chat with you
at the given time. Please feel free to attend at your convenience.

Office hours with Ben and Ophir are generally open door. However, students may
schedule meetings during this time with the course directors, and scheduled
students will receive precedence. To schedule a meeting, send a quick e-mail to
the course directors. There are some days where there are preexisting conflicts
with regularly scheduled office hours. We've created a 
[table with details](https://github.com/bvoight/GCB535/blob/master/OfficeHours.md)
for your convenience.

* BFV: Friday 3-4p
* OS: XXX

## Course web site

We will use [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) for in class exercises
and homework. Completed assignments will be collected through this system.
[Canvas](https://upenn.instructure.com/) is used to return grades to students.

## Course description

This course provides broad overview of bioinformatics and computational biology
as applied to biomedical research. A primary objective of the course is to
enable students to integrate modern bioinformatics tools into their research
activities. Course material is aimed to address biological questions using
computational approaches and the analysis of data.

A basic primer in programming and operating in a UNIX environment will be
presented, and students will also be introduced to R and tools for
reproducible research. This course emphasizes direct, hands-on experience with
applications to current biological research problems. The course is **NOT
INTENDED** for computer science students who want to learn about biologically
motivated algorithmic problems; GCB/CIS/BIOL536 and GCB537 is more appropriate.

Areas include DNA sequence alignment, genetic variation and analysis, motif
discovery, study design for high-throughput sequencing, RNA gene expression,
single gene and whole-genome analysis, machine learning. The relevant principles 
underlying methods used for analysis in these areas will be introduced and discussed 
at a level appropriate for biologists without a background in computer science.

The course will assume a solid knowledge of modern biology. An advanced
undergraduate course such as BIOL421 or a graduate course in biology such as
BIOL526 (Experimental Principles in Cell and Molecular Biology), BIOL527
(Advanced Molecular Biology and Genetics), BIOL528 (Advanced Molecular
Genetics), BIOL540 (Genetic Systems), or equivalent, is a prerequisite.

## Note on Reproducibility and Responsible Research
Scientific rigor and reproducibility (SRR) is essential for progress, and especially so in 
Bioinformatics. This course aims to address SRR by teaching students programming
and computational pipeline building skills, so that students can generate results that are
"technically reproducible" - that the same code run on the same input file generates
the same output file or result each time. Moreover, the class will teach students
technical an intuitional skills on how to look at, and evaluate, data sets they are 
provided that might be established or new. This helps to generate SRR because 'bugs'
or technical artefacts in data files hinders the production of reproducible results. 
Students who leave the course will have developed their intuition and 'healthy skepticism'
new data sets they encounter, and a framework to evaluate, visualize, and correct
issues in data as they are encountered.

## Equipment prerequisite

All students are required to bring a laptop to class for in class activities.
TAs will provide help with the material, but students should be computer-capable
with their own laptop, and should be willing/capable to download and install
free software from the Internet.

## Schedule

The most up to date schedule for the course is available in the [course
calendar](https://github.com/bvoight/GCB535/blob/master/Course_Calendar.md).

## Grading

### Composition of grades

Grades are composed of:

* homework assignments (50%)
* prelab assignments (5%)
* participation (5%)
* Exam One (20%)
* Exam Two (20%)

For the homework grade, we will drop scores from the 6 lowest scoring
assignments when determining the final grade.

### Late grading policy:

Our late grading policy is driven by fairness. This policy allows us to
return assignments quickly while providing flexibility where it is required.

* Prelab assignments are collected at the start of class. We are unable to
accept late turn-ins. This material is required in order to fully participate
in the in class exercises.

* Homework for the previous week will be due at the start of each week on Monday
at the start of class (e.g. homework assigned Monday, Wednesday, and/or Friday
is due at the start of class on the next Monday at 10:00a). 

* Homework will be accepted up to Wednesday of that week, but grades will be penalized 
(minus 30% off). If you would like to have an assignment graded under this late policy, 
you must e-mail one of the course directors before the start of the class period in question.

## Plagiarism policy

Consistent with the University of Pennsylvania's honor code and policies on
academic integrity, we maintain a zero-tolerance policy on plagiarism. For
assignments containing text that the instructors determine is plagiarized,
students will receive a grade of zero for the assignment and the case will be
referred to the Office of Student Conduct for disciplinary measures. Students
may not always be aware of what constitutes plagiarism in their work. If you are
unsure, please contact one of the course directors. Please see links below
regarding the office of academic integrity for Penn’s policy on plagiarism and
our discretion on grading.
